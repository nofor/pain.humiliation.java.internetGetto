//      Task 1. Write a program that prints the number of zero elements in a given integer array.
//      Task 2. Write a program that prints the maximum element of a non-empty array.
//      Task 3. Write a program (linear search) that defines the first occurrence of a given
//          integer x in an array of integers that knowingly contains this number.
//      Task 4. Write a program that prints the number of maximum elements of a nonempty
//          array in which only one cycle is used.
//      Task 5. Write a program, print an array, then invert (that is, swap the first element
//          with the last, the second with the penultimate, etc.), and print again.
//      Task 6. Write a program that prints an array, then sorts it (that is, rearranges its
//          elements so that they are arranged in nondestructive order), and prints again.
//      Task 7. Write a program that determines whether the entered phrase is a palindrome.
//          A Palindrome is a phrase whose inverting does not change it. In this case all the gaps
//          in the phrase are ignored.
//      Task 8. Write a program that cyclically shifts array elements to the right one position,
//          and prints the result. Cyclic means that the last element of the array becomes the very
//          first element its element.
//      Task 9. Write a program that cyclically shifts the elements of the array to the right
//          by "k" positions, and prints the result.
//      Task 10. Write a program that replaces all elements of the array, except the extreme ones,
//          by half the sum neighbors, and prints the result.
//      Task 11. Write a program that counts two non-empty arrays of integers in the range from
//          zero to nine decimal representation of two numbers, prints their difference.
//      Task 12. Write a program that consists of two non-empty non-decreasing arrays of integers,
//          prints those and only those elements that occur in at least one of the arrays (the union of sets).
//      Task 13. Write a program that consists of two non-empty non-decreasing arrays of integers,
//          and prints those and only those elements that occur in both arrays (the intersection of sets).
//      Task 14. Write a program that consists of two non-empty non-decreasing arrays of integers,
//          prints those and only those elements that enter only one of the arrays (symmetric
//          difference of sets).
//      Task 15. Write a program that writes the first 100 natural numbers to the array,
//          dividing into 13 or 17, and printing it.
//      Task 16. Write a program that prints an integer number in an array of integers
//          local maximum (the element is a local maximum if it does not have neighbors,
//          greater than he himself).
